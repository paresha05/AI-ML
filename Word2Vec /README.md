Sample "Game of Throne"'s Text Data collected from Kaggle and saved in Data directory.

Preprocess data using NLTK and Gensim libraries.

Read files from Data directory and convert text into token.

Gensim's Word2Vec model is configure and model feed with generated tokens.

Model will build unique words and get train with those words.

After successful training, I can perform similarity search.

Trained model save with unique name.
